ðŸ”§ Project Idea: Motor Direction & LED Toggle Using AVR Timer0

Hardware:

ATmega328P (or any AVR with Timer0)

2 LEDs (Left, Right)

1 DC motor (H-bridge driver like L293D/L298N or simple transistor-based driver)

1 push button

Logic:

On reset, motor is at center (stopped). Both LEDs OFF.

When button is pressed the first time â†’ rotate motor right, right LED toggles fast.

When button is pressed the second time â†’ rotate motor left, left LED toggles fast.

Each press toggles between right and left direction.

When button is not pressed, motor stops, LEDs stop toggling.
