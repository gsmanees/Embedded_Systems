C programming assessment
1. Write a function in C that takes an array of integers and its size, 
   and returns the second largest element. Constraints: ● Do not sort the array. 
   ● Assume the array has at least two distinct elements.
2. You are given an 8-bit register represented as an unsigned char. 
    Write a function to: ● Set the 3rd bit (bit index 2). ● Clear the 6th bit (bit index 5). 
    ● Toggle the 1st bit (bit index 0). Return the modified register value. 
    Note: Use bitwise operators only. Avoid loops or conditionals.
3. Write a C program to print a pyramid of stars for a given number n. 
If n = 5, the output should be:
              *
            ***
          *****
         *******
       *********
